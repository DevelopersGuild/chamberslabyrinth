Dungeon of the Dead (???)

-main character opens his eyes to see an otherworldly figure (tutorial guide) that tells him that the test begins now.
The main character has only one thing in his mind: to survive. Tutorial begins. Tutorial ends.

-As the story unfolds, after each boss fight, the main character:
1)1st boss- Learns his own name and that he has someone he must save

2)2nd boss- Learns that he has died because of car crash, but he keeps on going because he has a feeling that he still has something to do.

3)3rd boss- Learns that his son was with him during the accident and he has a strong feeling that his son is still alive

4)4th boss- suddenly remembers that he protected his son and died because of it.
He then proceed to curse his powerlessness and died anyway.
Death took pity of him and gave him a chance to live again...

5)5th boss- the "tutorial guide" appears after the boss fight and the main character recognizes him as Death.
He remembers that he made a contract with death:
he is allowed to live again, but he must prove that he's worthy to live by passing this trial and eventually kill Death.
He charges to kill Death, but he can't even get close to Death because of their huge difference in power.
Death laughs and teleports away.

6)bosses

-the final boss is the Death, with several forms.

-upon defeat, Death reveals that there's no such thing as the contract.
Depending on their resolve to stay alive upon their deaths, living creatures can stay in the world as ghosts.
The main character's resolve to live for his son was too strong that his spirit tried to rejoin his body,
a case so rare that Death took interest in him and designed the Dungeon of the Dead to test the strength of his spirit.
